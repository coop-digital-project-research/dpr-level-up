# Level Up: Financial freedom through early planning

This is a prototype web application, built to show 5 people as part of a Design Sprint. Digital Product Research built it to answer the question **can we shift people from instant gratification towards long term pay off?**

Financial freedom means:
* Having a (passive) income that pays for the life you want
* Not being reliant on a salary
* Time to spend as you wish
* Independence, from an employer or from the state
* Extra income streams
* Reducing your outgoings
* Buying yourself time
* Break out of feudalism

Our target audience are people who:
* Want a financial plan (is a bit worried)
* May or amy not have one
* Are Open minded
* Are young enough to do something about it (<40 yrs old)
* Are New earners
* Know they want something in the future but don't know what
* Want to have (free) time in the future
* Read things like: The 4 hour work week, Rich dad, poor dad, Smart women finish rich, Millionaire next door, Richest man in Babylon, Motley fool
* Are not in debt crisis
* Earn £20K + a year
* Could find £100 (is financially resilient)
