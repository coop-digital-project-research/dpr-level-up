<h1>
  Cut spending and boost income
</h1>



<p>
Your target is to reduce your spending to Â£1,500 a month.
</p>

<p>
  How quickly this happens is up to you. Ditching the [coffee] is a good start, but the more you cut out, the faster you'll reach your goal.
</p>

<p>
  And when you have cash left over - you can invest it and make it work for you.
</p>

<h2>Get there faster!</h2>

<h2>
  Your mentor is there for you
</h2>

<p>
  Your mentor [name] is there for you on your journey to financial freedom. Mentors aren't experts, but they have grown their passive income by cutting spending, and can be there with a friendly word of encouragement when you need it.
