  <p>
    Marian studied photography, but ended up in a stressful job in marketing. She wanted to break free, and was prepared to make some big spending cuts to achieve her goal.
  </p>
  <p>
    “I decided I needed to make a change. I read around to see how other people had escaped and came up with a plan. I spent a year preparing for the day when I was going to hand in my resignation. I moved back in with my parents and saved as much of my salary as I could. I stopped spending on anything that was not necessary - clothes, eating out, taxis. I joined my local library and cycled to work.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I worked evenings and weekends for a year. Every penny went into my investment account. It was tough but it was worth it. Now the income from the money I saved gives me enough to live on while I get started as a photographer. I still live frugally - and I love it! I’m in control of my life and my future.”
</p>

  <img src="../images/mentors/chris.jpg" class="mentor-image" alt="Chris" />
  <p>
    Chris was always out of cash by the end of the month, and the amount he owed wasn’t going down. With credit card debts to clear and a student loan, money was always a source of worry.
  </p>
  <p>
    “I had a moment when I realised I’d never have the things my parents did - a home, a family, a fun retirement. And I couldn’t understand why. I started going back through my statements and seeing what I was spending money on. Even though I was always stressing about money, I was blowing  it on things to make me less stressed - the pub after work, eating out, bars and gigs.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “I started setting a budget. Now I have a bit of money at the end of the month which is great. Some goes towards paying off debts, and some I invest which pays me a small income. When I think about money now, I’m much more relaxed. I’m not there yet, but I’m getting there.”
  </p>

<div id="choose-your-work-case-study" class="case-study">
  <img src="../images/mentors/marie.jpg" class="mentor-image" alt="Marie" />
  <p>
    Marie was finally earning the salary she wanted. She was able to afford a lot more stuff, but she was still stressed out.
  </p>
  <p>
    "Working full time was taking its toll. I had to work out what was really important to me. I used to think new clothes every month made me happy. I used to think the gym was the only option, and that the stress of my job meant I deserved all those little treats. But the reality was that these things were a trap. I was working to live and living to work.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Now I run instead of paying for the gym and make a pack lunch instead of eating in a cafe. These 2 simple changes save me thousands of pounds a year. I’ve cut out a lot of other expenses, and I don’t miss them. I invest the money I save and the income from that means I now work 4 days a week. In 5 years I’ll work 2 days a week, so I can spend more time volunteering, which I love.”
  </p>

<div id="spend-time-with-family-case-study" class="case-study">
  <img src="../images/mentors/mark.jpg" class="mentor-image" alt="Mark" />
  <p>
    Mark was leaving for work before his children woke up. When an old friend asked him to be his best man, Mark realised they'd not seen each other for 4 years. How did this happen?
  </p>
  <p>
    “I needed to make time for the people in my life who are important to me - which meant working less. I was able to go down to 4 days a week, but we really noticed the drop in income. We had to save, and I couldn’t see how. Where did our money go? A quick look around our kids' bedrooms told us the answer; expensive toys, clothes and gadgets.”
  </p>

  <p>
    “We had an honest discussion about spending. The kids were great - they went through all their things and made a huge pile of stuff to sell on eBay. Now invest the money we save in stocks and shares ISAs for their future. We buy stuff second hand now - or do without. I get to spend more time with the family, and you can't put a price on that.”
